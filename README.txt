   > LVL 2
  - Get close to the Apple
  - Tap L to eat the apple 

  > LVL 3
  - To open the door, get close to the key and tap L.
  - To make the first Rock disappear, light up the torch or change the levers 
to the mentionned position (unlocked-locked-unlocked)
  - To make the second Rock disappear, go on the pressure plate. It will make the rock disappear
for few seconds.
  - To make the last rock disappear, open all the lights by just passing on them

PS: We have changed the logic attributs of the second and third rock. It is due to the fact that lights are always 
cligning, making the third rock disappearence not so trivial.

We have tried to submit a version with a musical background. However, due to the portal limitation stockage, 
we have left this part of the code commented in the Enigme file.
