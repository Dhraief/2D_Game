    to the mentionned position (unlocked-locked-unlocked)
  - To make the second Rock disappear, go on the pressure plate. It will make the rock disappear
    for few seconds.
  - To make the last rock disappear, open all the lights by just passing on them

    PS: We have changed the logic attributs of the second and third rock. It is due to the fact that lights are always 
    cligning, making the third rock disappearence not so trivial.
